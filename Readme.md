# Ghriail Scripts

## Path configurations

### Script runner:

The script runner is at the top of the root to make sure that the os.getcwd() would return the correct working directory automatically.

### Pathing

All project related paths will be setup automatically.

However, `paths_external` is for the user to configure for the right locations.
