# Ghriail Scripts

## Path configurations

### Script runner:

The script runner is at the top of the root to make sure that the os.getcwd() would return the correct working directory automatically.

### Pathing

Most of the paths should be automatically recognised from the current working directory of the project.

However, as the engine location could be at a different path, make sure to `configure` the path with your `engine location`.
